**Loan Prediction Analytics - A Comprehensive Machine Learning Solution**

This project implements a complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting loan approval status using a diverse set of algorithms and techniques. The solution includes 15+ machine learning models covering regression, classification, clustering, and deep learning approaches, with an interactive Streamlit web application for real-time predictions.

### 🎯 Key Features:
- **15+ ML Models**: Regression (Linear, Polynomial, Logistic), Classification (Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, SVM, KNN, Random Forest, Bagging, AdaBoost), Clustering (K-Means, Hierarchical), Neural Networks (MLP, CNN, LSTM)
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC, Confusion Matrix, MAE, MSE, RMSE, R² Score
- **Advanced Techniques**: PCA for dimensionality reduction, Cross-validation (K-Fold, Leave-One-Out), Ensemble methods
- **Interactive Web App**: Streamlit-based interface for model comparison, predictions, and performance visualization
- **Automatic Model Selection**: System automatically identifies and uses the top 2 best-performing models

### 🚀 Technologies Used:
- Python, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Streamlit, Pandas, NumPy, Plotly

### 📊 Results:
- Best Model: Logistic Regression (86.18% accuracy)
- Second Best: Support Vector Machine (85.37% accuracy)

Perfect for learning ML concepts, comparing algorithms, and building production-ready loan prediction systems.
